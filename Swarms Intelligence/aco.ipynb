    "Ants emerged on Earth approximately 100 million years ago, and their current population is estimated to be around $10^{16}$ individuals. Remarkably, the total biomass of ants is believed to be comparable to that of humans, highlighting their significant ecological presence. Most ants are social insects, living in colonies that can range from a few dozen to millions of individuals. This social structure is integral to their survival and success, as it allows for complex interactions and division of labor among colony members. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intricate behaviors observed in ant colonies arise from the collective actions of many relatively simple individuals. Each ant operates as a stimulus-response agent, responding to cues from their environment with basic actions that often appear random. However, when these individual actions are aggregated, they result in highly organized and structured social systems. For instance, tasks such as foraging, brood care, and defense are performed through a decentralized process where individuals communicate and coordinate their activities without a central authority. This emergent behavior is a hallmark of social insects and demonstrates how simple interactions can lead to sophisticated collective outcomes."

    "Understanding the dynamics within these colonies requires examining both individual cognition and the communication networks that connect them. Social insects exhibit a remarkable capacity for collective cognition, where the group's responses to environmental stimuli often surpass the capabilities of individual ants. This phenomenon is facilitated by diverse communication methods, including pheromones and tactile signals, which allow ants to share information about resources and threats. As a result, the interplay between individual behaviors and group interactions is crucial for maintaining colony efficiency and adaptability in changing environments."

    "Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), developed by Marco Dorigo in the early 1990s, draws inspiration from the remarkable path-finding behaviors exhibited by various ant species. When ants discover a food source, they must transport it back to their nest, leading to the formation of \"transport trails.\" These trails are marked with chemical substances known as pheromones, which serve as odor signatures. Since most ants have limited vision, pheromones, along with sound and touch, become their primary means of communication. By following the pheromone trails left by their fellow ants, they can efficiently navigate to food sources. The quantity of pheromone secreted not only indicates the quality of the food but also signals its abundance. Artificial pheromone replicates the properties of natural pheromones, serving as an indicator of a solution's \"popularity\" in the context of the optimization problem being addressed. Essentially, artificial pheromone acts as a form of long-term memory, capturing and encoding information about the entire search process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of leaving chemical traces in the environment that prompt responses from other individuals is referred to as **stigmergy**. The term comes from Greek roots meaning \"mark\" and \"work,\" highlighting how ants can coordinate their actions without needing a comprehensive understanding of their surroundings. Stigmergy allows ants to discover and follow the shortest paths to resources based solely on local information. As ants explore their environment randomly, those paths that are more frequently traveled—due to increased pheromone deposits from multiple individuals—gradually become the preferred routes. This self-organizing behavior enables colonies to adapt effectively to changing conditions while optimizing their foraging efficiency."

    "A compelling example of the self-organizing behavior in ants is illustrated by the double-bridge experiment conducted by Goss et al. in 1989. In this experiment, the nest of the ant species Iridomyrmex humilis was connected to a food source via a double bridge, with each branch differing in length. Since ants are nearly blind, they cannot visually discern which side of the bridge is shorter. Additionally, the design of the bridge prevents them from gathering information based on the angle at which the two branches diverge, as both start at a 45-degree angle before diverging further along their paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "During most trials, it was observed that nearly all ants quickly began to favor the shorter branch of the bridge. This behavior can be explained through a process involving pheromone deposition (illustrated in the figure above). Initially, both branches are equally chosen by ants since neither has any pheromone trail (steps 1 and 2). However, ants traveling down the shorter branch reach the food source more quickly due to its reduced travel time (step 3). Upon returning, these ants notice a greater concentration of pheromones on the shorter branch because more ants have already traversed this route to reach the food (steps 4 and 5). As a result, this reinforces their preference for the shorter path, leading to an almost exclusive choice of this route over time (step 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying principle at work here is known as **auto-catalysis**: as more pheromones accumulate on a path, it attracts even more ants. This positive feedback loop means that the more frequently a path is traveled, the stronger its pheromone signal becomes. Consequently, this systematic reinforcement allows ant colonies to efficiently identify and utilize optimal routes to resources without any centralized decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ants to successfully identify the shortest path to a food source, it is essential that they deposit pheromones in both directions—on their way to the food and on their return journey. If, for example, ants were to only leave pheromone trails while traveling to the food source, the dynamics would change significantly. Initially, the first ants returning from the food source would favor the shorter path due to its higher pheromone concentration. However, since these ants are not depositing pheromones on their return trip, the pheromone level on the shorter path would not increase systematically. Over time, this initial advantage would be diminished as ants arriving later via the longer path would equalize the pheromone levels.\n",

   "source": [
    "This principle holds true even when considering the return journey. If we assume that ants cannot remember which path they took and instead choose their return route based solely on pheromone concentration, the situation becomes more complex. In this scenario, ants returning from the food source would need to traverse the shorter path to reinforce its pheromone trail further. However, if they do not deposit pheromones on their way back, any initial difference in pheromone levels would eventually be balanced out by ants arriving later via the longer path. As a result, no lasting preference for the shorter route would develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inability of ants to consistently reinforce the shorter path through pheromone deposition in both directions ultimately prevents them from establishing a reliable route to resources. This highlights the importance of mutual reinforcement in collective behavior; without it, even an initially advantageous path can lose its appeal as pheromone levels equalize across both routes. Thus, effective foraging strategies depend on a continuous feedback loop of pheromone signaling that guides ants toward optimal paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "While random fluctuations in path selection can lead to a convergence on one of the branches, the outcome remains uncertain under these conditions. Ants choose their paths based on the pheromone levels present, but since their choices are essentially random, it is possible for nearly all ants to eventually favor the same branch of the bridge. However, whether this chosen path is the shorter or longer one is purely a matter of chance.\n"

    "Moreover, it is important to note that for the shortest path to be effectively identified, both branches must be available from the outset, and neither should have any pheromone deposits. If one path is already marked with pheromones, ants will tend to prefer that established route. This assertion is further supported by a second bridge experiment conducted by Goss et al. in 1989. In this experiment, the nest and food source were initially connected solely by the longer branch of the bridge. The shorter branch was introduced only after some time had passed. As a result, most ants continued to use the longer branch they had become accustomed to during the early stages of the experiment. Only in rare instances did ants switch to the shorter path, and these switches appeared to be driven by significant random fluctuations in their path choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment underscores the importance of initial conditions in determining foraging behavior. Once a path has been established and marked with pheromones, it can create a strong bias that influences ant behavior, making it difficult for them to adapt even when a more efficient route becomes available later on. This phenomenon illustrates how collective decision-making in ants can be heavily influenced by prior experiences and environmental cues.\n",

    "The natural principle described can be adapted for computer-aided optimization by addressing the challenge of finding the shortest paths in weighted graphs, such as determining the shortest route between two specific vertices. In this approach, each ant constructs a candidate solution by starting at one of the designated vertices and moving from vertex to vertex. The edge it chooses to follow is selected based on a probability distribution proportional to the amount of pheromone present on those edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a significant issue with this straightforward method is the potential for cycles in the paths taken by the ants. When an ant traverses a cycle, the pheromone it deposits can create a tendency for subsequent ants to follow the same cycle repeatedly. To mitigate this problem, pheromone is deposited only after the entire path has been completed, and any cycles present in that path are removed before pheromone deposition occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge arises from the possibility that the search may become overly focused on candidate solutions generated early in the process. Since these initial solutions receive pheromone reinforcement, there is a risk of becoming stuck with them or only slightly modified versions, leading to premature convergence—similar to issues encountered in evolutionary algorithms. To address this concern, **pheromone evaporation** is often introduced, which, while playing a minor role in nature, helps to balance exploration and exploitation. Additionally, enhancements such as adjusting the amount of pheromone deposited based on the quality of the candidate solution and incorporating heuristics for edge selection—taking into account both pheromone levels and edge weights—can further improve the optimization process.\n",

In the context of SACO, the quality of a solution—represented by the constructed path—is simply defined as the inverse of the path length in terms of the number of hops. Other measures can also be employed, such as the travel cost along the path or the physical distance covered. Generally, if $x^k(t)$ represents a solution at time step $t$, then $f(x^k(t))$ indicates the quality of that solution.\n",

Consequently, this leads to a reduced amount of pheromone being deposited on the link.

    "   - **Brute Force:** Check all possible permutations of city visits to find the shortest path. This approach is only feasible for a small number of cities.\n",
    "   - **Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp Algorithm):** Uses a recursive approach with memoization to reduce the number of subproblems. The time complexity is $O(n^2 \\cdot 2^n)$, which is better than brute force but still exponential.\n",
    "   - **Branch and Bound:** Systematically explores all possible solutions and prunes paths that cannot yield a better solution than the current best.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Heuristic Algorithms:**\n",
    "   - **Nearest Neighbor:** Start at a random city and repeatedly visit the nearest unvisited city until all cities are visited. This approach is fast but does not guarantee the optimal solution.\n",
    "   - **Christofides' Algorithm:** Uses minimum spanning trees and perfect matching to construct a solution that is guaranteed to be within 1.5 times the optimal solution for metric TSP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Metaheuristic Algorithms:**\n",
    "   - **Genetic Algorithms (GA):** Mimic the process of natural selection by generating a population of possible solutions and evolving them using crossover and mutation operators.\n",
    "   - **Simulated Annealing (SA):** Mimics the process of annealing in metallurgy by exploring the solution space and gradually reducing the \"temperature\" to converge to an optimal solution.\n",
    "   - **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):** Inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, uses a colony of artificial ants to explore possible solutions and update pheromones to guide future search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Other Approaches:**\n",
    "   - **Local Search (e.g., 2-opt, 3-opt):** Improve an existing solution by iteratively making small changes to reduce the total distance.\n",
    "   - **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):** Inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish, uses a swarm of particles to explore the solution space and update their positions based on personal and global best solutions.\n",
    "   - **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):** Use neural networks, particularly Hopfield networks, to model the TSP as an energy minimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these approaches has its strengths and weaknesses. Exact algorithms provide optimal solutions but are computationally expensive, making them suitable for small instances. Heuristics and metaheuristics are more scalable and can provide good approximate solutions within reasonable time frames, making them suitable for larger instances of TSP.\n",

    "In the following, we are going to tackle the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Simple Ant Colony Optimization (SACO). SACO is a simpler version of ACO, which typically doesn’t include pheromone evaporation or intensification mechanisms. In Simple Ant Colony Optimization (SACO), the heuristic information (like the inverse of the distance) is typically not used. Instead, SACO relies solely on the pheromone trails laid down by ants to guide the search for solutions. This makes SACO simpler and more straightforward compared to the Ant System (AS), which combines pheromone information with heuristic information (such as the inverse of the distance) to make decisions. We talk about Ant System algorithm in the next section."

The transition probability in AS balances between pheromone strength ($τ_{ij}$), which indicates the history of successful moves, and heuristic information ($η_{ij}$), which represents the desirability of the move. This balance effectively manages the exploration-exploitation trade-off. The search process favors moves that have proven effective in the past, thereby leveraging accumulated knowledge about the search space. Simultaneously, to uncover such moves, the algorithm must explore previously untried actions. Optimal exploration-exploitation balance is achieved through appropriate selection of the parameters $α$ and $β$. If $α = 0$, pheromone information is ignored, leading the search to a stochastic greedy approach. If $β = 0$, the attractiveness of moves is disregarded, making the search algorithm similar to SACO, with its associated issues. Heuristic information introduces an explicit bias towards the most attractive solutions and is thus a problem-dependent function. For instance, in problems where minimizing the distance or cost of a path is crucial, for $η_{ij}$ we have\n",

    "1. **Train an ML Model:**\n",
    "   - We use a simple linear regression model trained on historical data to predict completion times.\n",
    "2. **Generate Features for Job-Machine Pairs:**\n",

    "This framework allows us to leverage ML predictions to optimize job scheduling with ACO.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's perfectly fine that multiple jobs are assigned to the same machine. In job scheduling problems, it’s common for several jobs to be allocated to the same machine, especially when there are fewer machines available than jobs. The key objective is to minimize the overall makespan, which is the total time taken to complete all jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world scenarios, machines can process multiple jobs, often one after another. The goal is to find an optimal or near-optimal schedule that minimizes the total time or other defined costs, while ensuring all jobs are processed according to their constraints.\n",

    "Here’s why having several jobs on the same machine can occur and be beneficial:\n",
    "- **Machine Efficiency:** Some machines might be more efficient or faster, making it beneficial to allocate more jobs to them.\n",
    "- **Resource Availability:** Limited number of machines means they have to take on multiple jobs.\n",
    "- **Minimizing Idle Time:** Distributing jobs in a way that minimizes idle times across all machines can lead to better overall makespan.\n"

    "Combining Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with Neural Networks (NNs) can lead to some fascinating applications. One intriguing problem that comes to mind is **optimizing the architecture and hyperparameters of a neural network using ACO**.\n",

    "#### Problem: Neural Network Hyperparameter Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** \n",
    "Use Ant Colony Optimization to find the optimal architecture and hyperparameters of a neural network that maximize its performance on a given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components to Optimize:**\n",
    "1. **Number of Layers:** Determine the best number of hidden layers.\n",
    "2. **Number of Neurons per Layer:** Find the optimal number of neurons in each layer.\n",
    "3. **Learning Rate:** Optimize the learning rate for training the network.\n",
    "4. **Batch Size:** Determine the best batch size for training.\n",
    "5. **Activation Functions:** Select the best activation functions for each layer.\n",
    "6. **Optimizer:** Choose the optimal optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam, SGD, RMSprop).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach:\n",
    "1. **ACO Initialization:** \n",
    "   - Define the solution space for each hyperparameter (e.g., range of possible values for learning rate, possible number of layers, etc.).\n",
    "   - Initialize pheromone levels for each hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ant Solution Construction:**\n",
    "   - Each ant constructs a candidate solution (i.e., a set of hyperparameters) based on the pheromone levels and some heuristic information.\n",
    "   - Train a neural network using the constructed hyperparameters and evaluate its performance (e.g., accuracy on a validation set).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pheromone Update:**\n",
    "   - Update the pheromone levels based on the performance of the candidate solutions. Better-performing solutions deposit more pheromones, influencing future ants to explore similar regions of the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterate:** \n",
    "   - Repeat the process for several iterations, allowing ants to explore and exploit different areas of the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits:\n",
    "- **Exploration and Exploitation:** ACO's probabilistic nature allows for effective exploration of the solution space while converging towards optimal solutions.\n",
    "- **Adaptability:** ACO can dynamically adjust to changes in the solution space, making it suitable for complex, non-convex optimization problems like neural network hyperparameter tuning.\n",

    "\n",
    "Research has shown that the number of ants significantly impacts algorithm performance. A clear consequence of increasing the number of ants is the rise in computational complexity; as more ants are utilized, additional paths must be constructed and more pheromone deposits calculated. For instance, the computational complexity of the Ant System (AS) is represented as $O(n_c n_G^2 n_k)$, where $n_c = n_t n_k$ denotes the total number of cycles, $n_t$ is the total number of iterations, and $n_G$ represents the number of nodes in the solutions, assuming uniform node counts across solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lower number of ants diminishes the exploration capacity of the algorithm, resulting in less information about the search space being available to all ants. Consequently, using a small value for $n_k$ may lead to suboptimal solutions or premature stagnation. Conversely, employing too many ants is not always advantageous; for example, in simple Ant Colony Optimization (SACO), it has been demonstrated that excessive numbers can hinder performance. When $n_k$ is large, it may take considerably longer for pheromone levels on beneficial paths to rise compared to those on less favorable paths. It is crucial to optimize $n_k$ for each specific algorithm and problem scenario.\n",

Conversely, if $n_t$ is excessively high, it may lead to unnecessary computations, wasting resources without significantly improving the solution quality. Balancing this parameter is essential for achieving effective results in ACO algorithms."

    "\n",
    "During the initialization step, all pheromones are either initialized to a constant value, $τ_0$, or to random values in the range $[0,τ_0]$. In the case of random values, $τ_0$ is selected to be a small positive value. If a large value is selected for $τ_0$, and random values are selected from the uniform distribution, then pheromone concentrations may differ significantly. This may cause a bias towards the links with large initial concentrations, with links that have small pheromone values being neglected as components of the final solution. Thus, careful selection of $τ_0$ is essential to ensure a balanced exploration of the search space.\n",

    "Determining the optimal values for control parameters is a complex task with no straightforward solution. Although many empirical studies have explored these parameters, the recommended values and heuristics should be approached with caution. They are tailored to specific algorithms and problems, and should not be universally accepted. To maximize the efficiency of any algorithm, the control parameters must be fine-tuned for the particular problem at hand. This can be achieved through detailed empirical analyses. Alternatively, another algorithm can be employed to \"learn\" the optimal values of the parameters for the given algorithm and problem.\n",

    "Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms were initially designed to address discrete optimization problems, where the values assigned to the solution's variables are limited to a fixed set of discrete values. When attempting to apply ACO algorithms to continuous optimization problems, the main challenge is transforming the continuous space problem into a graph search problem. One straightforward method is to encode floating-point variables using binary string representations. For example, encoding a floating-point variable with an n-bit string results in a graph representation $G = (V,E)$ containing $2^n$ nodes, with each bit having two nodes (one for each possible value, 0 and 1), and links between every pair of nodes. This allows the use of discrete ACO algorithms for problem-solving. However, binary representation of floating-point values can result in a loss of precision. There are also ACO algorithms specifically designed to optimize continuous spaces without discretizing the solution variables.\n",

    "In dynamic optimization problems, the search space evolves over time. A solution that is currently effective may become suboptimal after an environmental change. Ant algorithms might struggle to adapt to these changes due to the buildup of strong pheromone concentrations. When most ants converge on the same solution, the high pheromone levels on the links representing that solution lead to a high probability of it being chosen by all future ants, even if conditions have changed.
