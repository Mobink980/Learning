    "The N-Queen problem can be solved using a **genetic algorithm**. A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by the process of natural selection. It is used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#6588EE\">In the case of the N-Queen problem, the genetic algorithm can be used to find a solution by generating a population of candidate solutions (chromosomes) and iteratively improving them through selection, crossover, and mutation operations. The fitness function for the N-Queen problem can be defined as the number of non-attacking pairs of queens on the board. The genetic algorithm can then be used to maximize this fitness function by iteratively generating new populations of chromosomes until a satisfactory solution is found.</span>\n",

Genetic algorithms, on the other hand, can handle larger problem sizes more efficiently by generating populations of candidate solutions and iteratively improving them through selection, crossover, and mutation operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Robustness**: Backtracking can be sensitive to the order in which the search space is explored. Genetic algorithms, on the other hand, are more robust to changes in the search space and can handle noisy or incomplete data more effectively.\n",
