    "**Crossover**, also known as recombination, is the process of combining two parent solutions to generate new offspring. This results in two offspring, each carrying some genetic information from both parents. The idea is to exchange some parts of the parents' strings to create a new string that may inherit some good traits from both parents, and it is analogous to the crossover that happens during sexual reproduction in biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In evolutionary computation, various algorithms may use distinct data structures to store genetic information (see [genetic algorithms](genetic_algorithms.ipynb)). Each genetic representation can be combined with different crossover operators. Bit arrays, vectors of real numbers, or trees are some typical data structures that can be recombined with crossover. Note that the same individual may be selected as both parents, and one individual may take part in producing more than one offspring. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Main categories** of crossover operators are:  <br>\n",
    "(1) <span style=\"color:#EE8877\">Asexual:</span> an offspring is generated from one parent, <br>\n",
    "(2) <span style=\"color:#77EFE5\">Sexual:</span> two parents produce one or more offspring, and <br>\n",
    "(3) <span style=\"color:#8799EE\">Multi-recombination:</span> more than two parents are used to produce one or more offspring."

    "## <a id='alternate-edges'>Alternate Edges Crossover (AEX)</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Alternate Edges Crossover (AEX) operator works by alternating between the edges of the two parents to create a new child.To operate alternate edges crossover on two selected parents, we first need to introduce a concept named `arc`. An `arc` is an edge in a parent solution (any pair of elements that are in a sequence). For instance, the arcs for parent-one is as follows: <br>\n",
    "`5-1`, `1-7`, `7-8`, `8-4`, `4-9`, `9-6`, `6-2`, `2-3`, `3-0`, `0-5` \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the arcs or edges in parent-two are: <br>\n",
    "`3-6`, `6-2`, `2-0`, `0-5`, `5-1`, `1-9`, `9-8`, `8-4`, `4-7`, `7-3`\n",
    "\n",
    "The AEX operator works by alternating between the edges of the two parents to create a new child. Now, we discuss how alternate edges crossover works with an example. Consider the following example where `parent-one = [5 1 7 8 4 9 6 2 3 0]` and `parent-two = [3 6 2 0 5 1 9 8 4 7]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For child-one, we start by the first arc in parent-one which is `5-1`. We find the position of the element `1` in parent-two and notice that the next arc in the sequence is `1-9`. Again, we look for element `9` in parent-one and we find out that the next arc in the sequence is `9-6`. We keep alternating between the parents, until we reach a cycle (where the next element in the sequence is already seen). If we find the element `3` in parent-two, the next element in the sequence would be `6` which is already seen. So, up until now, we have the following for child-one: <br>\n",
    "`child-one = [5 1 9 6 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1]` <br>\n",
    "where -1s denote the positions that are yet to be filled. We reached a cycle in parent-two, so we will randomly choose a value that is not already seen from the other parent which in this case is parent-one. If we choose `7` in parent-one, the corresponding arc would be `7-8` in parent-one, which then gives us the arc `8-4` in parent-two, and then the arc `4-9` in parent-one. Element `9` is already seen, therefore, we have another cycle. Thus far, we have the following for child-one: <br>\n",
    "`child-one = [5 1 9 6 2 3 7 8 4 -1]` <br>\n",
    "The only unseen element in parent-two is `0`. So, the final result for child-one would be: <br>\n",
    "`child-one = [5 1 9 6 2 3 7 8 4 0]` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a similar approach to calculate the genes of child-two, but this time, we start off by the arc `3-6` in parent-two. So, for child-two, we will have `child-two = [3 6 2 0 5 1 7 -1 -1 -1]` until we reach a cycle in parent-two (as the element `3` is already seen). If we choose the value `4` in parent-one, we get the arc `4-9` in parent-one, `9-8` in parent-two, and we are done! So, the final result for child-two will be: <br>\n",
    "`child-two = [3 6 2 0 5 1 7 4 9 8]`\n"

    "Let's say we have two parent chromosomes: `10101010` and `11001100`. We randomly select a subset of genes from each parent, say the first two genes from the first parent and the last two genes from the second parent. The resulting offspring will be `00101010` and `11001110`. As you can see, the offspring has a combination of genes from both parents, but the order of the genes has been disrupted. This helps to create a high degree of diversity in the offspring population.\n",

    "Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX) is a crossover operator used in genetic algorithms. It is designed to work with real-valued chromosomes. The SBX operator works by simulating the binary crossover operator used in binary-coded GAs. The idea is to retain the property of binary coding with single-point crossover, which states that the average of the parent chromosomes is equal to the average of the child chromosomes. In SBX, this property is retained by using a probability distribution that simulates the binary crossover. The crossover operator selects two parent chromosomes and generates two offspring chromosomes by applying the SBX operator. The SBX operator works by generating a random number between 0 and 1, and then using this number to calculate the beta value. The beta value is then used to calculate the offspring chromosomes from the parent chromosomes.\n",

    "Let's say we have two parent chromosomes: `p1 = [1.5, 2.0, 3.0]` and `p2 = [2.5, 3.0, 4.0]`. We randomly select a beta value between 0 and 1, say `beta = 0.5`. The resulting offspring chromosomes will be:\n",

    "## <a id='arithmetic'>Arithmetic Crossover</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic Crossover is a type of crossover operator used in genetic algorithms. It is designed to work with real-valued chromosomes. The arithmetic crossover operator works by generating a new offspring chromosome by taking a weighted average of the corresponding genes in the parent chromosomes. The weight is determined by a random number between 0 and 1, and the offspring chromosome is generated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "c[i] = alpha * p1[i] + (1 - alpha) * p2[i]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `c[i]` is the `i`-th gene in the offspring chromosome, `p1[i]` and `p2[i]` are the corresponding genes in the parent chromosomes, and `alpha` is the weight factor. The value of `alpha` is usually chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how arithmetic crossover works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have two parent chromosomes: `p1 = [1.5, 2.0, 3.0]` and `p2 = [2.5, 3.0, 4.0]`. We randomly select a weight factor `alpha = 0.5`. The resulting offspring chromosome will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "c = [2.0, 2.5, 3.5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the offspring chromosome has a combination of genes from both parents, but the values have been modified based on the weight factor.\n"
