    "# Selections in genetic algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection** is a stage in a genetic algorithm or more general evolutionary algorithm in which individual genomes are chosen from a population for later breeding, using the crossover operator. Selection mechanisms are also used to choose candidate solutions (individuals) for the next generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#EE9977\">The primary objective of the selection operator is to emphasize the good solutions and eliminate the bad solutions in a population while keeping the population size constant, giving more chances to the individuals with higher fitness scores to pass their genes to the next generation. </span> There are different methods of selection, such as roulette wheel, tournament, rank-based, etc. and we will walk through some of them together. As mentioned before, selection process can be described by two steps: (1) parents selection and (2) a replacement strategy that decides if offspring will replace parents, and which parent to replace.\n"

The winner of each tournament (the one with the best fitness) is selected for crossover. Selection pressure, a probabilistic measure of a chromosome's likelihood of participation in the tournament based on the participant selection pool size, is easily adjusted by changing the tournament size. The reason is that if the tournament size is larger, weak individuals have a smaller chance to be selected, because, if a weak individual is selected to be in a tournament, there is a higher probability that a stronger individual is also in that tournament.

    "In RWS, the probability of selecting a chromosome is proportional to its fitness score. However, this method can lead to premature convergence, where the population converges to a suboptimal solution too quickly. RWS with Stochastic Acceptance (RWSA) addresses this issue by introducing a stochastic element to the selection process.  \n",

    "Stochastic Universal Sampling (SUS) is a development of fitness proportionate selection (FPS) which exhibits no bias and minimal spread. In SUS, a single random value is used to sample all of the solutions by choosing them at evenly spaced intervals. This gives weaker members of the population (according to their fitness) a chance to be chosen. Using a comb-like ruler, SUS starts from a small random number, and chooses the next candidates from the rest of population remaining, not allowing the fittest members to saturate the candidate space. The main difference between this selection and Roulette wheel selection is that it gives more opportunity to individual with lower fitnesses.
